   typedef: gdImage

   typedef: gdImagePtr

   The data structure in which gd stores images. <gdImageCreate>,
   <gdImageCreateTrueColor> and the various image file-loading functions
   return a pointer to this type, and the other functions expect to
   receive a pointer to this type as their first argument.

   *gdImagePtr* is a pointer to *gdImage*.

   (Previous versions of this library encouraged directly manipulating
   the contents ofthe struct but we are attempting to move away from
   this practice so the fields are no longer documented here.  If you
   need to poke at the internals of this struct, feel free to look at
   *gd.h*.)
